Our research mainly focus on bio-inspired soft robotics that do work traditional rigid robots **cannot** handle. Based on the understanding of biomechanics, we synthesize robotics that can safely and effectively interact with human and complex surroundings.

By working closely with biologists, material scientists and mechanists, we are particularly interested in building robotics prototypes by using multiple soft materials, therefore to explore open challenging scientific questions in biomechanics such as swimming, adhesion and grasping. We also work closely with industrial people to bring our technologies into devices and products that meet the real-world applications.

### Our research interests

1. soft robotics
2. bio-inspired fabrication
3. comparative biomechanics
